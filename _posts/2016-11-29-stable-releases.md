I have been using [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org), a rolling-release Linux
distribution, for three years. This post does not aim at promoting or
reviewing a distribution, but the following considerations are directly
correlated to my own experience with a rolling-release distro: so this premise 
is worthwhile.

The most frequently expressed criticism against Arch Linux points out
the potential presence of unstable packages in repositories. Actually, this 
criticism is not unfounded. Arch Linux adopts an extremely simple policy for
managing its repositories. As soon as a new **stable** version is released
for a package by its upstream (i.e. by its developers), it is pushed into
Arch's repositories. As a partial exception, some packages have to pass through
the *testing* repository before reaching the final users. Anyway, they stay in 
that repository for a small period of time and the whole process for a new 
package is far shorter than on traditional distributions (e.g. Debian).
You understand that the probability of a buggy version reaching the final user
is greater than zero in this context.

Now, the question: "is the policy wrong?" Should Arch Linux maintainers keep
packages in *testing* repo for a longer period and possibly reject some 
updates? It is easy to answer to the latter question: in my opinion, they simply
can't. Maintaining a rolling-release distro forces you to keep the pace of
releases from upstream (at least, if you have a limited amount of "human
resources" to test all new versions of software).

It seems to me that there is nothing wrong with immediately upgrading 
packages to latest *stable* release from upstream. Arch's policy is not that
wrong. Simply, sometimes what comes from upstream **is not so stable**. 
Open-source developers (and we'd be proud to be included into that group) love 
to release new versions of their software, showing fresh shining features to
users. In most cases, they haven't got enough time or resources to thoroughly 
test the code before releasing. In a *perfect open-source world*, upstream would
release only stable software and distributions could (almost) blindly push new
versions into repos. *In real world*, they need help in testing new versions; in
fact, having rolling-release users trying fresh packages is a help.

Beware, this is not criticism against open-source developers! And neither I
am saying that "traditional" distros like Debian are wrong in trying to deliver
only (really) stable packages to users! I just would like to make you think
about compromises that today exist, so that we can move towards a simpler 
interaction between upstream developers and package maintainers, for a more 
mature open-source ecosystem. Let's work for it - being you a developer, a
maintainer or a user. There is a huge amount of code to test, a lot of bugs to
report and fix and - hopefully - there will always be less effort in maintaining
package repositories!
